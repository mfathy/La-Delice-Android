    <string name="label_about">About Us</string>
    <string name="desc_about">Established 28 years ago in beautiful Lorne Park, Mississauga, Le Délice Pastry Shop creates deliciously decadent French-inspired cakes and pastries.

We specialize in fresh, handmade cakes, pies, croissants, tarts and squares, but we are especially loved for our cookies and delicious chunky chicken pies.

We only use fresh whole eggs, sweet butter, 35% whipping cream and the very best Belgian chocolate.

We have been part of all the memories since 88′ and will continue to be there for you.</string>
